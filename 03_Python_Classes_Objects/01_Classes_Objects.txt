# Python is an object oriented programming language.

# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# USE CASES

# Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something.

# For example, in a game, you could create a class called Character, which could store information about the character, such as the character's name, strength, dexterity, hit points, etc.

# A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class.

# An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class.
